    This is a place to play with Large Language Models (LLMs) for educational purposes only. The demo limited output tokens and is not appropriate for a real-world use.  
    **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a demo from the sidebar** to see some examples of what LLM can do!
    - LLMs are fine-tuned to be helpful. See how a base model compares to a fine-tuned model that is more helpful.
    - LLM parameters and system prompts can change how LLMs generate responses.
    - Some LLMs are open source and some are fine-tuned for specific purposes (e.g., coding).
