# LLM_Sandbox
## 1. Description
This is a place to play with Large Language Models (LLMs) for educational purposes only.  
The demo limited output tokens and is not appropriate for a real-world use.
- Compare base model (Babbage-002) and fine-tuned model (GPT-3.5 Turbo)
- Change LLM parameters and system prompts to see how LLMs generation can be useful
- Compare GPT-3.5 Turbo to Llama 2 7B Chat, Llama 2 70B Chat, and CodeLlama 34B Instruct models 

## 2. Demo App
